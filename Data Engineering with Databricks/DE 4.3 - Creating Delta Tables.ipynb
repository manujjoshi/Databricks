This pattern ensures that even if data doesn't match expectations with regards to data types or column names, no data will be dropped, meaning that programmatic or manual intervention can still salvage data in a partially corrupted or invalid state.\n\nThis lesson will focus primarily on the pattern used to create most tables, **`CREATE TABLE _ AS SELECT`** (CTAS) statements.\n\n## Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this lesson, you should be able to:\n- Use CTAS statements to create Delta Lake tables\n- Create new tables from existing views or tables\n- Enrich loaded data with additional metadata\n- Declare table schema with generated columns and descriptive comments\n- Set advanced options to control data location, quality enforcement, and partitioning"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"5947c4f0-e357-45e3-a2b1-31b0289743b2"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Run Setup\n\nThe setup script will create the data and declare necessary values for the rest of this notebook to execute."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"e54277e4-a663-4fb0-9bbf-8ee92a42c809"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%run ../Includes/Classroom-Setup-4.3"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"693f6a00-1b3e-4bec-a179-60c3c776f822"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Create Table as Select (CTAS)\n\n**`CREATE TABLE AS SELECT`** statements create and populate Delta tables using data retrieved from an input query."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"099b0420-8bec-46ee-bea7-2be188fb7f3e"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE TABLE sales AS\nSELECT * FROM parquet.`${da.paths.datasets}/raw/sales-historical/`;\n\nDESCRIBE EXTENDED sales;"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"62eba247-a4b1-486d-8e27-9db534dd01c4"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["CTAS statements automatically infer schema information from query results and do **not** support manual schema declaration. \n\nThis means that CTAS statements are useful for external data ingestion from sources with well-defined schema, such as Parquet files and tables.\n\nCTAS statements also do not support specifying additional file options.\n\nWe can see how this would present significant limitations when trying to ingest data from CSV files."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"9580af54-3a44-4641-9a4b-3059de3b979d"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE TABLE sales_unparsed AS\nSELECT * FROM csv.`${da.paths.datasets}/raw/sales-csv/`;\n\nSELECT * FROM sales_unparsed;"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"b81eb39c-f261-4bc4-8069-697161034813"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["To correctly ingest this data to a Delta Lake table, we'll need to use a reference to the files that allows us to specify options.\n\nIn the previous lesson, we showed doing this by registering an external table.
