In the past, much of the emphasis for streaming with big data has focused on reducing latency to provide near real time analytic insights. While Structured Streaming provides exceptional performance in achieving these goals, this lesson will focus more on the applications of incremental data processing.\n\nWhile incremental processing is not absolutely necessary to work successfully in the data lakehouse, our experience helping some of the world's largest companies derive insights from the world's largest datasets has led to the conclusion that many workloads can benefit substantially from an incremental processing approach. Many of the core features at the heart of Databricks have been optimized specifically to handle these ever-growing datasets.\n\nConsider the following datasets and use cases:\n* Data scientists need secure, de-identified, versioned access to frequently updated records in an operational database\n* Credit card transactions need to be compared to past customer behavior to identify and flag fraud\n* A multi-national retailer seeks to serve custom product recommendations using purchase history\n* Log files from distributed systems need to be analayzed to detect and respond to instabilities\n* Clickstream data from millions of online shoppers needs to be leveraged for A/B testing of UX\n\nThe above are just a small sample of datasets that grow incrementally and infinitely over time.\n\nIn this lesson, we'll explore the basics of working with Spark Structured Streaming to allow incremental processing of data. In the next lesson, we'll talk more about how this incremental processing model simplifies data processing in the data lakehouse.\n\n## Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this lesson, you should be able to:\n* Describe the programming model used by Spark Structured Streaming\n* Configure required options to perform a streaming read on a source\n* Describe the requirements for end-to-end fault tolerance\n* Configure required options to perform a streaming write to a sink"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"e01896cc-7d95-4b1e-aa6a-96a2bca4dd96"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Getting Started\n\nRun the following cell to configure our \"classroom.\""],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"3f74a574-a363-4362-a9de-f7d956689d5f"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%run ../Includes/Classroom-Setup-6.2"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"f4260795-0df8-4582-922d-1ae291d7ec98"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Treating Infinite Data as a Table\n\nThe magic behind Spark Structured Streaming is that it allows users to interact with ever-growing data sources as if they were just a static table of records.\n\n<img src=\"http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/img/structured-streaming-stream-as-a-table.png\" width=\"800\"/>\n\nIn the graphic above, a **data stream** describes any data source that grows over time. New data in a data stream might correspond to:\n* A new JSON log file landing in cloud storage\n* Updates to a database captured in a CDC feed\n* Events queued in a pub/sub messaging feed\n* A CSV file of sales closed the previous day\n\nMany organizations have traditionally taken an approach of reprocessing the entire source dataset each time they want to update their results. Another approach would be to write custom logic to only capture those files or records that have been added since the last time an update was run.\n\nStructured Streaming lets us define a query against the data source and automatically detect new records and propagate them through previously defined logic. \n\n**Spark Structured Streaming is optimized on Databricks to integrate closely with Delta Lake and Auto Loader.**"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"0da66afc-5638-43fc-9c7a-4c8b0b293788"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Basic Concepts\n\n- The developer defines an **input table** by configuring a streaming read against a **source**. The syntax for doing this is similar to working with static data.\n- A **query** is defined against the input table. Both the DataFrames API and Spark SQL can be used to easily define transformations and actions against the input table.\n- This logical query on the input table generates the **results table**. The results table contains the incremental state information of the stream.\n- The **output** of a streaming pipeline will persist updates to the results table by writing to an external **sink**. Generally, a sink will be a durable system such as files or a pub/sub messaging bus.\n- New rows are appended to the input table for each **trigger interval**. These new rows are essentially analogous to micro-batch transactions and will be automatically propagated through the results table to the sink.\n\n<img src=\"http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/img/structured-streaming-model.png\" width=\"800\"/>\n\n\nFor more information, see the analogous section in the <a href=\"http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html#basic-concepts\" target=\"_blank\">Structured Streaming Programming Guide</a> (from which several images have been borrowed)."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"b40287ab-e586-497e-be8d-c8ed8e61684b"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## End-to-end Fault Tolerance\n\nStructured Streaming ensures end-to-end exactly-once fault-tolerance guarantees through _checkpointing_ (discussed below) and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-ahead_logging\" target=\"_blank\">Write Ahead Logs</a>.\n\nStructured Streaming sources, sinks, and the underlying execution engine work together to track the progress of stream processing.
